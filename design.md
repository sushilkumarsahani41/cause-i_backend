Designing an easy-to-use API from the database schema provided involves planning your endpoints around the resources (surveys, questions, options, responses, translations) and considering the actions users need to perform on these resources. Here's a suggested approach based on RESTful principles, aiming for clarity, simplicity, and functionality.

### 1. Surveys

- **Create a Survey**
  - `POST /surveys`
  - Payload includes `title` and `description`.
- **Get All Surveys**
  - `GET /surveys`
- **Get a Single Survey**
  - `GET /surveys/:survey_id`
- **Update a Survey**
  - `PUT /surveys/:survey_id`
  - Payload can include `title` and `description` to update.
- **Delete a Survey**
  - `DELETE /surveys/:survey_id`

### 2. Questions

- **Add a Question to a Survey**
  - `POST /surveys/:survey_id/questions`
  - Payload includes `type`, `title`, `image_url`, `image_caption`, and `status`.
- **Get Questions for a Survey**
  - `GET /surveys/:survey_id/questions`
- **Update a Question**
  - `PUT /questions/:question_id`
  - Payload can include fields that are allowed to be updated.
- **Delete a Question**
  - `DELETE /questions/:question_id`

### 3. Options (for Questions)

- **Add Options to a Question**
  - `POST /questions/:question_id/options`
  - Payload includes an array of `option_text`.
- **Get Options for a Question**
  - `GET /questions/:question_id/options`
- **Update an Option**
  - `PUT /options/:option_id`
  - Payload includes `option_text` to update.
- **Delete an Option**
  - `DELETE /options/:option_id`

### 4. Responses

- **Submit a Response**
  - `POST /responses`
  - Payload includes `survey_id`, `question_id`, `option_id` (for MCQ and QUANT), `saq_response` (for SAQ), and `respondent_id`.

### 5. Translations

- **Add a Translation**
  - `POST /translations`
  - Payload includes `reference_id`, `language`, `translated_text`, and `audio_url`.
- **Get Translations for a Reference**
  - `GET /translations?reference_id={id}`
- **Update a Translation**
  - `PUT /translations/:translation_id`
  - Payload can include fields that are allowed to be updated.
- **Delete a Translation**
  - `DELETE /translations/:translation_id`

### General Design Considerations

- **Versioning**: Prefix your API endpoints with a version number (e.g., `/v1/surveys`) to allow for non-breaking changes in the future.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Secure your API using appropriate mechanisms (e.g., JWT tokens) and ensure that users have the right permissions to perform actions.
- **Validation**: Validate request payloads to ensure they meet the expected format and data types.
- **Error Handling**: Provide clear error messages and appropriate HTTP status codes for different types of errors.
- **Pagination**: For endpoints that can return a lot of data (e.g., listing surveys or questions), implement pagination to limit the amount of data returned in a single request.
- **Filtering and Sorting**: Allow filtering and sorting of lists (e.g., surveys, questions) based on various attributes to enhance usability.

Designing with these considerations in mind will help you create an API that is not only easy to use but also robust and secure.
